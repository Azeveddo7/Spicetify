### ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Warning

The theme automatically updates for users using the version of Spicetify equals or greater than `2.8.2`, however, for the users that don't want to update Spicetify to the newest version:

1. Go [here](https://comfy-themes.github.io/Spicetify/Comfy/theme.script.js)
2. Copy the whole code (sorry for the flashbang)
3. Go into the Spicetify/themes/Comfy folder.
4. Open the `theme.js` file, paste the code and **save it**
5. Afterwards, in a terminal, run `spicetify apply`
6. Enjoy !

For the users that don't want to update Spicetify to the newest version, do the same with [this](https://comfy-themes.github.io/Spicetify/Comfy/app.css) and paste it in the `user.css` replacing the `@import`.

### üñåÔ∏è Customization

---

Go into your theme folder and open either :

`color.ini` for the colors

`user.css` to modify the code
