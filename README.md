### üì• Installation

Go into your `Themes` folder in `.spicetify` then do :
```sh
git clone https://github.com/NYRI4/Comfy-spicetify
```

If you want to have the image header on a playlist, move the `Comfy.js` file to the `Extensions` folder and do :
```sh
 spicetify config extensions Comfy.js
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Warning
I don't think I can import an external stylesheet from the `user.css`, means that if I do an update, you'll need to `git pull` to stay up-to-date.

### üñåÔ∏è Customization
Go into your theme folder and open either :

`color.ini` for the colors

`user.css` to modify the code
